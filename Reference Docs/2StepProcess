🛠️ Multi-Step Image Generation and Editing Workflow (OpenAI-compatible)
Step 1: Generate Base Image (Text-to-Image)
Use /v1/images/generations (prompt-only) to generate a first version based on your ultra-detailed prompt (the one you and I built).

Save the result (base64 or URL) temporarily on your backend or in your app.

✅ Purpose: Get a rough but detailed Barbie-style figure.

Step 2: Upload User’s Reference Images
Collect the uploaded real photos (already being done in your app — beautiful!).

Save them into cloud storage (e.g., Supabase Storage, S3, etc.) and/or cache locally for processing.

✅ Purpose: Hold the real images for editing.

Step 3: Perform an Image Edit or Inpaint (Merge/Modify)
Now that you have:

A base generated doll image from Step 1

The user’s real images

👉 You now send both to the /v1/images/edits OpenAI endpoint or use another image editing model (like Stability’s ControlNet).

Basic edit flow:
Upload the base generated image as the input.

Use inpainting / masking OR merging techniques to replace parts (e.g., facial features, body shape) based on the user’s real photos.

In OpenAI style (editing endpoint):

json
Copy
Edit
POST /v1/images/edits

{
  "image": [the base generated doll image],
  "mask": [optional: a mask image if you only want to modify certain areas],
  "prompt": "Update the face and body to match the uploaded reference photo while maintaining Barbie collectible styling. Use glossy textures and pastel background."
}
✅ Purpose: Overwrite key parts of the generated doll with the real human reference traits.

Step 4: Final Output
Receive the edited doll image from the edit step.

Save to user's gallery or show the preview.

Optionally let users request another final refinement ("Fine tune hair" / "Change pose" etc.).

✅ Purpose: Deliver a true-to-life Barbie-style action figure based heavily on the real person.

✨ Key Benefits of this Flow
More realistic results: Not relying on text only.

Personalized dolls: Customized faces, outfits, poses.

Higher quality control: You refine instead of hoping one generation is perfect.

Scalability: Easy to batch automate or let users tweak at each stage.

🛠 Tools you could use for Step 3 (Editing/Refining)

Tool	What it Does	Pros	Notes
OpenAI /v1/images/edits	Basic edits + mask areas	Very clean and OpenAI ecosystem	Limited fine control

🧠 Small bonus tip
You could even auto-create masks using simple tools if you want to only edit the head, the hands, or the outfit on the base image —
for example:

Auto-generate a mask around the face

Only inpaint the face from the user’s photo

Leave hair, outfit, and body untouched

That way your figure still looks "Barbie stylized," but the important details like face and body proportions are hyper-faithful.

📦 Quick Code Overview (conceptual)
typescript
Copy
Edit
// Step 1: Generate base
const baseImage = await generateImageFromPrompt(finalPrompt);

// Step 2: Save reference uploads
const referenceImages = await saveUploadedImagesToStorage(files);

// Step 3: Edit base image using references
const editedImage = await editImageWithReference({
  baseImage,
  referenceImage: referenceImages[0],
  editPrompt: "Update face and body to match reference photo while maintaining Barbie doll styling."
});

// Step 4: Deliver to user
showImageToUser(editedImage);

1 | Generate first draft Barbie figure (prompt-only)
2 | Upload & save user's real photos
3 | Edit the base image using reference images (face, body swap)
4 | Output polished, ultra-realistic collectible figure
